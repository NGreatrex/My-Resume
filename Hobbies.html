            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>I enjoy playing music in my spare time in my band Bad Heritage, in that band I play Drums but I also play quite a few different instruments.</p>
            <p>To name a few in order of level of skill</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Drums</li>
                <li>Banjo</li>
                <li>Ukulele</li>
                <li>Guitar</li>
                <li>Bass</li>
                <li>Piano</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>When I'm not behind a drum kit I like to play a variety of different video games, from strategic team based games, to deeply narrative rich roleplaying games (a counter product of what you will soon read below).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Table-top roleplaying games</h3>
            <p>I often like to arrange games nights, at my house and invite a group to participate in a pre-planned adventure where I as the games master will guide them through a tale where they can all work together to achieve a common goal. This can very often go of the pre-planned track and I will have improvise methods of getting a large group back onto track with their mission.</p>
